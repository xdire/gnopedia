# gnopedia
Curious case of RPCs masquerading in smart contracts

# Design for the implementation 
Find it here [Package design PRD](r/gnopedia/docs/prd.md)

# Testing strategy

1) Run `gnodev *` to launch the package


2) Add test key to `gno` keychain: `gnokey add --recover test1`
Default mnemonic is (check with the `gnodev` output):
```
source bonus chronic canvas draft south burst lottery vacant surface solve popular case indicate oppose farm nothing bullet exhibit title speed wink action roast
```

3) Use the help section of the UI to copy development commands to use `Gno` transactions as following
